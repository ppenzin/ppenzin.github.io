-- [Half-arsed agile manifesto][haam]

For all who are familiar with Agile (but beware, you won't be able to unsee it):

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/J6oMG7u9HGE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This is a [TED][ted] video, it is a couple years old and it is somewhat
hillarious. It could have been a parody on Agile Coaching and family
counseling, but, unfortunately, [he is serious][bf].

He claims that he is using [agile][am] <s>to manage his family</s> in his
family, but the stuff he is saying sounds more like Agile's evil corporate
[cousin][haam] with "_the simple new process that will make your company more
successful_".

There is just so much wrong with the video, from the belief that software
development methodologies can be applied to family life, to what Agile and
Waterfall are, to fictional "Agile Programming". Ironicaly, it is not uncommon
to see similar things in companies that claim to be doing Agile. On the upside,
at least he is not referring to his children as "resources".
