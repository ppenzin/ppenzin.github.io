Here is what you need to get started.

### App catalog update
HP released an app catalog update on July 23, 2013. If you reading this now,
then you are already late, which means that you would not be able to update the
App Catalog or install any apps. Luckily enough the restriction is only a "time
bomb", so here is what you do:

- Cancel all failed application installations.
- Change the date to July 1, 2013 (and disable "network time").
- Go to the app catalog and search for "udpate". Find and install "App Catalog Update". If that does not work, try restarting the phone with the date still beeing 2013-07-01.
- Set the date back, turn on "network time".
