Hi, my name is Petr. I also spell and pronounce it as "Peter" (the
Petr/Piotr/Peter confusion is thanks to Russian Federal Migration Service).

I am a software engineer: I work on compilers and explore various open-source
projects in my spare time. I am not speaking on behalf of my employer, all the
opinions presented here are mine and only mine.
