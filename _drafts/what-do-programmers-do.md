This old rant came up in a conversation with a colleague, here is a
[link](https://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/so/2003/01/s1005.pdf) or
[two](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220092569_The_Software_Developer_as_Movie_Icon).
Warren Harrison (former PSU CS chair and IEEE Software editor) wrote an
excellent take on what's wrong with CS education. He does a little bit of old
man rambling and, of course, in his opinion it is the students, but his article
really does expose a lot of problems in the system itself.

Colleague's reaction was: "this is hopeless, if people draw information about
their future field from movies then nothing could be done." While the idea than
undergrads would be inspired by popular culture to choose their major sounds silly,
there nothing too astonishing about it. I think the main reason this happens is
information vacuum surrounding STEM disciplines in the US. While everyone
thinks Computer Science pays well (and therefore *you* should chose major in
it), but no one really knows what is it about; therefore there is such a stark
contrast between what people think we do and what we actually do. A separate
problem is what is taught in CS classes (the primary reason students stay
ignorant to the nature of their field for so long), but that is a big enough
topic for a separate post.

While Warren hits it right on about team players and ability to express
thoughts in English, Computer Science and especially "algorithm-heavy" parts of
it should be viewed as something close to high-level finance industry: there
are things there that have drifted pretty far away from "everyday" reality and
require a lot of special knowledge to understand.
