Hi, my name is Petr. I also spell and pronounce it as Peter (the whole Petr/Piotr/Peter confusion is thanks to Russian Government's ID Services).

I am a software engineer: I work on compilers and explore various open-source projects in my spare time. I am not speaking on behalf of my employer, all the opinions presented here are mine and only mine.
